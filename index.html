                    <p>Township and rural areas usually lack the infrastructure needed to have reliable and cost effective internet connectivity [1]. Internet connections in townships are typically slow, low bandwidth wireless connections when compared to internet connections in developed regions [2]. With the emergence of Web 2.0 technologies, the Web has become more socially connected and people are able to share content via the Web more often than before [5]. It has been noted that there is a lack of local content on the Web from rural Africa and that the Internet is often perceived as a “foreign body” [12].
                    The importance of low cost internet connectivity in township and rural areas is motivated by the benefits towards education and the overall development of the community [3]. Internet performance and cost is an obstacle that prevents local community members from sharing content via the Web. Additionally, this prevents usage of high-bandwidth Web applications such as Skype and YouTube.</p>

                    <p>Poor communities in rural areas and townships lack fast and efficient internet connectivity at an affordable cost. For example the Internet connection in Macha, a rural settlement in Zambia is provided through a satellite gateway that has a committed download speed of 128 kbps bursting to 1 Mbps which is below the recommended minimum of 4mbps [5]. The total monthly cost of the connection is $1200 (USD) which is unaffordable to the low-income rural residents. With evidence of strong locality of interest in these communities as evidenced in Macha Zambia, a fast, efficient and free local network for file sharing and communication can be set using open source tools [5]. The research questions below aim to discover how this local cloud can be improved to provide a better service to its users in a community.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Research Questions:</h3>
                    
                    <p>1. Can an intelligent decision tree synchronisation technique reduce internet data costs as opposed to a simplistic first in first out (FIFO) synchronisation technique, and how does data availability of the decision tree technique compare to the first in first out (FIFO) technique, for users that travel to different local servers?</p>
                    <p>2. Can a peer-to-peer file sharing method be used as a fall back solution in the event of the server being unavailable and still maintain one hundred percent availability of data, and how does the average bandwidth of the peer-to-peer connections compare to the average bandwidth of the client-cloud connection?</p>
                    <p>3. Can a decentralized social network be integrated with other server applications to increase the usage and ease of access (through social network login) of server applications?</p>

                    <h4>Bottom-up view:</h4>

                    <p>  The novelty of Jeff’s visualization is seen on its interactive and clean design. According to a well-known web designer, Shaun Cronin , “A clean design communicates a sense of refinement and sophistication” (Cronin, 2012), and this is exactly what is required when there is a need to quickly determine visual queries.</p> 



                    <h4>Top-down view:</h4>

                    <p>The visualization has a number of filters, which are used to generate robust data set combinations. This results in a substantial number of visual queries. Some examples of visual queries would be; which race has the highest number of population in the country? and which age group has the highest number of females? </p>



                    <p>The filters are made with convex buttons, this adds to the visualizations interactiveness. The white text, which is inside the buttons, works well with the contrasting blue colour of the button. And the population colour saturation, which is from light blue to dark blue, is used effectively. We used some of the aspects implemented by Jeff in his visualization.</p>



                    <h4>Drawbacks:</h4>

                    <p>We noticed a few drawbacks that could be improved in Jeff’s visualization. Jeff could have used symbols to show gender and a pop up cue when a user hovers over a South African province.</p>



                    <h3>Honours Project 2015:</h3>

                    <p>

                      We also considered visualizations made by the 2015 computer science honours class. The visualization that stood out for us was the Crime Income Inequality Visualization, created by Adam Sundstrom and Robert Passmore. This is because the visualization uses a map graphic that is similar to the one we use in our visualization. The following images are visual query screen-shots of the visualization. (Hover over image to see visual query and click the white eye in the middle to view image):

                    <p>Similar to Jeff's visualization, this visualization also provides a number of filters, which are used to generate robust data set combinations. This results in a substantial number of visual queries. Features that were important to us on this visualization, were the dimensions that were used to generate the visual queries. </p>



                    <p>The visualization uses two channels, which are namely shape and colour, to distinguish the homicides per 1 million people. This makes the visualization easy to interpret and thus making it easy to identify important visual queries. The visualization also uses a blue colour gradient effectively to indicate the Gini coefficient.

                    <p>The average income is the most important visual query in our visualization. This is because it determines the countries value and has an impact on the countries GDP and crime rate (Hodgson, 2012). If a province has a low average income, it will sell less goods and thus produce less jobs. This results in high unemployment and crime (Hodgson, 2012).</p>

                    <h3><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Which province has the HIGHEST POPULATION DENSITY?</h3>

                    <p>The second ranked visual query is the population density. Through research, we found that the population question is a bit controversial, specifically noting Chinas' ordeal. According to a study made by Robert England (England, R, 2005), Chinas' attempts to reduce its population because of economic dangers (pollution etc) has backfired due to the fact that there are not enough professionals to take care of the aging community and that are employable in the working sector . This shows that the correct population amount with a diverse age group is vital for a countries economic growth.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Which province has MOST EDUCATED YOUTHS?</h3>

                    <p>Intuitively, people that would want educated children would want to stay at a location with a high matric pass. The reason why we ranked this at number 3 is because there is not enough extensive research to prove that this intuitive belief is correct.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> How does one province compare to another?</h3>

                    <p>This is a general question that would be answered through  different comparisons between different dimensions of our visualization. Incidentally, the answer would differ with each person.</p>

                    <p>The reason why this is ranked last in our list of visual queries is because it is purely opinion based.</p>

                    <h3>First Design:</h3>

                    <p>

                    After the visual queries, we decided to use the iterative design approach to construct our initial design. We first looked at ways of representing the average income per province in the South African map. We decided to use the colour channel, but one obstacle was to find a colour gradient that was suitable for the human eye and fit the income attribute.

                    </p>



                    <h4>Average Income Design:</h4>

                    <p>

                    The figure below shows the different design iterations for the average income per province. On our first design, which is written design 1 below the hovered image, we randomly selected different colours for different income brackets. We realized that this approach was not good for the human eye because of the high colour saturation. On our second design, we reduced the saturation but we realized that the random colours were not clear for a lay audience. This resulted in us choosing a similar colour scheme for design 3, and with a bit of colour refinement, for provinces that had similar colours, we finally came up with design 4.

                  <p>

                    The figure below shows the different design iterations for the population density per province. In our first design, we considered using Jeff's method for visualizing population. Jeff used a blue gradient colour scheme to distinguish the population, which was a low saturated blue to a high saturated blue. We realized that this method could conflict with the income per province dimension. This resulted in us using a small dot texture in the second design. We then realized that the dot texture was to small and congested to notice and properly determine the population. This resulted in us using shapes in our third design and finally using both colour and shape in our design. This enables users to quickly identify visual queries.

                    The figure below shows the different design iterations for the matric pass rate per province. In the first design, we thought of using a vertical fill colour as a measure of each province but this approach lead to difficulties picking up visual queries. We then used a horizontal fill colour in our third design and this was easier to understand than the first design.

                  <p>

                    The two negative critics that we received were about our lack of dimensions used and the way we represented the Matric pass rate in our visualization. We then decided to use a graduation-hat symbol for the pass rate. We also added two dimensions in our visualization. The first dimension that we added was the South African race category per province. We had difficulties representing this in our visualization but eventually added the race on the border of each province as seen in the prototype. We also struggled whilst selecting a colour scheme to represent the race. We finally decided to represent the race colour according to the colour that society deems appropriate for a specific race, e.g we used the black colour for African dark brown people.

                  <h4>Second Design Feedback:</h4>



                  <p>

                      The areas that were criticized on our second design were namely the graduation-hat, which represents the Matric pass rate, the colour density used for the population per province and the race border around the provinces. The 3D graduation-hat was criticized for being a distraction. One suggestion that was given, was to make the hat 2D or to select a better image. The race border was also criticized for being a distraction and ineffective for the visual queries that we generated. Below is a thorough and concise discussion on how we sought to rectify our errors.

                          <p>

                          After our second design and listening to the feedback we decided to take our visualization in a completely different direction. We decided to try scrapping what we had and to recreate a smoother visualization using D3. Since none of us has had any experience with D3 it posed a slight problem. It was with a group effort that we tried to make the best of a bad situation. Below is a link to our incomplete attempt at perfecting the census visualization in D3.

                          </div>

                        </div>

                  </div>



                  <p>

                  The visualization is, in our opinion, visually appealing however there are many flaws. The coding made it difficult to display more than just colour on the map. In our previous attempt one of the feedback points was that it was impressive that we used texture as well, as this lead to more visual channels being used. We, therefore, wanted to keep the same sort of design with the D3 rendition. D3’s data manipulation and visualization techniques are fantastic, however not suited for exactly what we envisioned to display and how we wanted to display the information. The animation properties of D3 also encouraged us to persevere and try new ways of displaying the data, this of course provided us with a platform of rethinking our design and finding ways to better our initial design using this library of magical visualization gadgets (as can be seen in our incomplete visualisation).

                  </p>



                  <h4>A Breakdown of what is happening in the incomplete D3.js visualization:</h4>

                  <p>

                  At the top-centre of the page we have white text that displays the full name of the province upon hovering over a particular province. The text is white on a black area of the background, thus a good colour contrast exists in order to bring your attention to the name of the province. The contrasting colours in combination with the changing of the text when hovering over different provinces. This changing of text is an instance of motion which is an infamous technique of attracting attention. And just so that the user knows which province he/she is hovering over the provinces border changes colour to white which makes the province “pop” out at the viewer.

                  </p>



                  <p>

                  The provinces are coloured according to the annual average household income, higher income provinces are greener than those with lower incomes which tends toward a more red colour. The colours green and red were chosen due to the sayings: “my bank account is in the green/ red”. We felt that these colours were already ingrained in majority of viewers with the intended meanings. Thus we felt that these colours were perfect for representing income. POINT: earlier we had to decide between representing which dimension of the data with the colour of the province. In general, colour has been used to represent population density as can be seen in Jeff’s visualization. However, we wanted to represent the population density using texture (very difficult in D3).

                  </p>



                  <p>

                  When the viewer clicks a province the other provinces shrink and move to the upper right corner in a rectangle. This was also a comment that was made during our first presentation, “it’s useful to always have an overview of the country somewhere on the visualization.” We decided to implement this in this rendition, we also wanted to improve on it. The viewer will notice that when he/she clicks on a province an incomplete country moves to the corner, with the missing piece of the country puzzle being the province that’s been selected. Now the viewer can decide to select another province from the small map in the top right corner. The new province will enlarge and move toward the other selected provinces to complete a new big puzzle of the country. When the viewer clicks on one of the selected provinces, the clicked province becomes deselected and shrinks back to the top right corner.

                  </p>



                  <p>

                  BUT what else do you notice when a province is selected or deselected? Yes, some form of motion in the top left corner. A bar grows and is connected to one of the blue lines below it. This line represents the population density of the province being selected. We decided to abandon this visualization before adding the province initials to the lines as well as the population density amount. The length of the lines have been normalised using D3’s linear scale function.  Bars are semi-transparent to aid comparison between different provinces’ population densities. Obviously, the more provinces that are selected the more bars will be in the top left corner.

                  </p>



                  <p>

                  In the bottom right corner the viewer can see the population amounts of the different provinces. It is a stacked bar graph and the different stacks represent the different races in the provinces. It was at this point that we decided to abandon the D3 idea. Thus the visualization was left incomplete at this point, the reasons for this decision are outlined below.

                  </p>



                  <h4>Reasons for abandoning the D3 rendition:</h4>



                  <p>

                  Although the D3 library allows for really awesome transitions and animations, in this visualization we gradually saw that certain problems arose. Firstly, using the colour scale for income from green to red, there are many provinces with similar incomes which is very difficult to distinguish which province has higher income or lower income. Another problem that we encountered was that we could only show 2 dimensions on the map and all using only one channel, colour. Basically the map became very similar to a "duck" where it is nice to look at but offers very little information. Thirdly, stacked bar graphs, although visually appealing, are problematic and make comparisons very difficult. For example, whites in Northern Cape versus whites in Gauteng. Finally, we were of the opinion that using the different attributes that we have used the lines, map and bar graphs we were no longer just using one visualization but three.  This defeats the purpose of the project, thus we decided to abandon the idea, even though it looked visually crisp and clear and provided many visually stimulating transitions and additional tools for visual effects.

                      <p>

                      In the final design, we wanted to go for a crisp, clean visualization that can represent as much data as possible. That being said, we decided to leave out a couple of dimensions such as age and gender as these would lead to the visualization being too noisy and cluttered. As mentioned in the strengths and weaknesses section, Gauteng  is so small in comparison to all the other provinces that trying to populate it with different icons, fills and textures become nearly impossible. To address this problem we decided to put the visualization techniques used for Gauteng outside the map with arrows pointing towards the province. This allows us to add more dimensions to the data visualization but comes at the cost of losing some cleanliness of the design. In a succinct summary, we have really learned to dislike Gauteng, but thanks to all the courses we attended we found a way around the obstacle without physically destroying our computers.

                      <p>

                      We went back to using the shape texture to fill the provinces. This method provides 2 different channels confirming one piece of information. Given that the texture fill might be a bit difficult to compare between different provinces, using shapes as well allows the viewer another means of comparison. It is easier to see the difference between triangles and circles but not the difference between 1000 and 1001 little dots.

                      </p>



                      <p>

                      As mentioned before we have stuck with the colour differentiation to represent income. Since we used Microsoft paint the colour scale is ordinal instead of linear meaning that the colours are used to rank the provinces by their income levels. This was decided at the beginning of the project for two reasons; firstly, when looking at visualisations ones first instinct is to find some sort of sense in the data and this often occurs by ranking the data, x is bigger than y etc. Secondly, our visual queries are aimed at instant comparisons not necessarily delving into the exact amounts even though this will be hinted at using the visualization key. For a more in depth view of the data we want the viewer to click the province he or she is interested in and that data will be clearly displayed and then precise comparisons can be made.

                      </p>



                      <p>

                      For matric results we wanted to try something different and eye catching so we used a 3 dimensional icon of a graduation cap with the pass rate percentages written on  them. The caps are also sized according to the pass rates, provinces with a higher pass rate are fitted with a larger graduation cap. We decided to give the representation of gender and sex another shot, moving away from borders and semi-filling the provinces to represent date. We now were leaning towards using icons to represent gender and a bar to represent race this was a quick means of representing the data however we know that it is not the best means of representing these dimensions as it makes comparisons a little tricky.

                      <h4>Prototype Caveats</h4>

                      <p>

                        <li>We couldn't get pictures of the individual provinces so we used the ones from the second design. But the data used to in each  province is still accurate.</li>

                        <li>When you hover over a province you will notice that the red border line is not aligned with the actual South African map. This is due to the dimension of the map.</li>

                      <p>We found it difficult to add some of the visual cues in the Gauteng province because of its small size.</p>

                      <p>We had some problems representing some of the data clearly on the visualization because of the high number of dimensions that we used in our visualization.</p>

                      <p>Our visualization design is not entirely clean, which means it lacks refinement (Cronin, 2012).</p>

                    <p>Our main aim was to design a visualization that would give tourists a platform to compare and carefully decide which province they wanted to travel or raise their kids or family. It feels as if we have come a far way, trying lots of different techniques from filling provinces to represent matric pass rate, switching to graduation caps, moving from representing population density using texture shapes, to using dots and now we are back to shapes. We have certainly tried our best to respond positively to constructive criticism, admittedly we may or may not have attended many seminars on anger management and self-help courses, from which we have learned, “we are awesome, but there are always ways to become awesomer and we want to be the awesomest we can be!!” Criticism continues to be a little painful though. After carefully designing and responding constructively to criticism, we finally made sufficient progress with a visualization that supports anyone interested in knowing more about South Africa.</p>
